# Kaltura API SDK - Native Client Libraries

When developing applications that interact with the Kaltura API, it is best to use a native Client Library.

Below you can download the Client Library for the programming language of your choice.

Please note, the client libraries provided here have been generated for the Kaltura.com SaaS API.
Users of self-hosted editions of Kaltura (On-Prem or CE) are encouraged to use their Kaltura Server Clients Generator for optimal compatibility.

To learn how to use the client libraries and see example code implementations, use the API Test Console.
The Test Console automatically generates sample code based on the API actions and parameters you select.
